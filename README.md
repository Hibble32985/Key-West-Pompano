As a coding boot camp student I should take a trade specific quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript that is timed and the high scores will be stored for later review.  This will assist me in gauging my progress and I can compare this score to those of my peers.

Assessments such as this this will also be of assistance for to help me as a developer to determine where I need improvement.  And, this could be an important part of the interview process as employers often use the resulting scores to screen and "weed out" job candidates that do not match the criteria of a minum specific score or better. 

The timed quiz will be technical in nature with interview questions that can be answered that reflect what has been learned in the course. As the quiz progresses, the difficulty level of the questions will increase and upon completion a score will be issued.  Once the specific set time has been reached the quiz will no longer accept any responses, meaning if you are in the process of answering a question but have not selected and committed to an answer it will not be accepted as a valid response no matter what the response was intended to be even if it was correct. Nor will additional questions be presented to the quiz taker.

This will aid in becoming more proficient developer as it will help reflect where additional attention may be needed in knowledge.  Using such a tool, exceptionally good for practice purposes, it will assist in being well-prepared for a technical interview in the future.

To participate in this code quiz, it will commence when the start button is pressed.  Once this has been done the timer will begin and a question will be presented to the quiz taker.  Upon commiting and submitting an answer to the displayed question, another question will be presented until the allotted time is complete at which the quiz will be over and no longer continue.  

Time is subtraced from the clock whether a question has an incorrect answer or not submitted.

Once all questions have answers submitted OR the times reaches 0 (zero) the quiz is over.  Once all questions have had an answer submitted the quiz will be over whether or not a correct answer has been submitted.

Upon the completion of the quiz, the quiz taker can save the score with his/her initials entered to correspond.
