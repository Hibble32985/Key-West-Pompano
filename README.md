As a coding boot camp student one would benefit from taking a trade specific quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript that is timed and the high scores to be stored for later review.  This will assist a student in gauging progress and to compare this score to those of peers.

Assessments such as this this will also be of assistance for a student developer to determine where improvement is needed.  This could be an important part of the interview process as employers often use the resulting scores to screen and "weed out" job candidates that do not match the criteria of a minimum specific score or better. 

The timed quiz will be technical in nature with interview questions that can be answered that reflect what has been learned in the course. In this quiz as it progresses the difficulty level of the questions will increase and upon completion a score will be issued. All questions must have an answer submitted in order to progress to the next question whether or not a correct answer has been submitted. Once the specific set time has been reached the quiz will no longer accept any responses  This means if one is in the process of answering a question but has not selected and submitted an answer it will not be accepted as a valid response, no matter what the response was intended to be, even if it was correct. Nor will additional questions be presented to the quiz taker.

This quiz will aid one in becoming a more proficient developer as it will help reflect where additional attention may be needed in professional knowledge.  Using such a tool will not only be exceptionally good for practice purposes, it will assist the quiz taker in being well-prepared for a technical interview in the future.

To participate in this code quiz, it will commence when the start button is pressed.  Once this has been done the timer will begin automatically and a question will be presented to the quiz taker.  A response must be made to each question.  The answer will be noted as correct or incorrect immediately. An incorrect response will result in time subtracted from the clock. Upon commiting to and submitting an answer to the displayed question, another question will be presented until the allotted time is complete (0) or all questions have been answered at which the quiz will be over and no longer continue.  

Upon the completion of the quiz, the quiz taker can save the score with his/her initials entered to correspond.
